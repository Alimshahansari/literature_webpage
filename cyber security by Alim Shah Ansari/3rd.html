        <font face="Poppins" color="azure">
            In December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) charged the leader of an organized cyber-criminal group for their part in a global Dridex malware attack. This malicious campaign affected the public, government, infrastructure and business worldwide . <br>

            Dridex is a financial trojan with a range of capabilities. Affecting victims since 2014, it infects computers though phishing emails or existing malware. Capable of stealing passwords, banking details and personal data which can be used in fraudulent transactions, it has caused massive financial losses amounting to hundreds of millions. <br>
            
            In response to the Dridex attacks, the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre advises the public to “ensure devices are patched, anti-virus is turned on and up to date and files are backed up”.

       .       Romance scams
        </font>
    </h3>
         <p>
            <font face="Poppins" color="azure">
                In February 2020, the FBI warned U.S. citizens to be aware of confidence fraud that cybercriminals commit using dating sites, chat rooms and apps. Perpetrators take advantage of people seeking new partners, duping victims into giving away personal data. <br>
                The FBI reports that romance cyber threats affected 114 victims in New Mexico in 2019, with financial losses amounting to $1.6 million.

            <font face="Poppins" color="green">
           .       Emotet malware
            </font>
        </h3>
             <p>
                <font face="Poppins" color="azure">
                    In late 2019, The Australian Cyber Security Centre warned national organizations about a widespread global cyber threat from Emotet malware. <br>

                    Emotet is a sophisticated trojan that can steal data and also load other malware. Emotet thrives on unsophisticated password: a reminder of the importance  of creating a secure password to guard against cyber threats.
